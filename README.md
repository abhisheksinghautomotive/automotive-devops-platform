### Planned (To Be Added)
These are referenced in earlier vision but not yet present:
- `docs/learning-roadmap.md`
- `docs/interview-preparation.md`
- `docs/architecture-decisions.md` (ADR index or numbered ADRs in `docs/adr/`)
- `ai-learning/` directory containing:
    - `ai-learning-guide.md` (can reuse `.github/instructions/ai-learning-guide.instructions.md` content symlink or copy)
    - `concept-explanations/` (per-topic breakdowns)
- `progress-tracking/learning-metrics.md`
- `progress-tracking/milestone-achievements.md`

### Suggested Naming / Cleanup
- Consider renaming `projects_documentatioms/` → `projects_documentations/` or `project-specs/` for clarity.
- Optionally introduce `docs/adr/` with numbered ADR files (e.g., `0001-telemetry-ingestion-bus.md`).

## 🤝 AI-Assisted Learning

An internal AI instruction file already exists at `.github/instructions/ai-learning-guide.instructions.md`.

Planned exposure steps:
1. Copy or symlink it to `ai-learning/ai-learning-guide.md`.
2. Add topic stubs (e.g., `concept-explanations/streaming-vs-batch.md`).
3. Reference AI usage within each project README ("Guided Questions" section).

Guiding Principles Recap:
- 🤔 Questions over direct answers.
- 🧪 Encourage experimentation & measurement.
- 🎯 Tie implementation choices to interview storytelling.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Achievement Targets (Aspirational)
- Reliability: 99.9% component uptime target (will define SLOs per service)
- Performance: < 2s end-to-end telemetry availability; < 100ms query latency for hot path
- Cost: Optimize storage & streaming costs (KPIs to be baselined in Project 01)
- Security: Encrypted in transit & at rest + least privilege IAM from first commit

### Learning Outcome Targets
- System Design Story: High-scale ingestion & processing pipeline
- Technical Depth: Choices justified with measurable trade-offs
- DevEx: Reusable patterns across six projects
- Career Narrative: Bridge from automotive testing → platform engineering

## 🤖 AI Learning Integration

**Learning Philosophy**: Socratic method - AI asks questions to guide discovery rather than providing solutions.

**Usage**: Each project includes AI-assisted learning components that help you:
- Understand core concepts through guided questions
- Prepare for technical interviews with relevant scenarios
- Build practical skills through hands-on implementation
- Develop problem-solving approaches used in industry
