Enable toggling cloud sync by config or CLI arg.\n\nExit Criteria:\n- Events written to cloud bucket (real or emulated) or logged as would-be uploaded\n- Demo/test script for local+cloud export\n- Docs updated with usage and caveats\n",

Allow swap by config for test and local/CI runs.\n\nExit Criteria:\n- Each received event logged to configured store\n- Example Docker Compose for local receiver + DB\n- Docs with sample queries, schema, limitations\n",
