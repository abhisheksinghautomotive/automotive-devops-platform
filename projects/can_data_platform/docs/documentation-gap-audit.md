# Documentation Gap Audit

| Artifact name                    | Status   | Action (create/defer) | Owner   |
|----------------------------------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)        | Missing  | Create               | Self    |
| Battery signal schema docs                 | Present  | -                    | Self    |
| Battery evolution/simulation model docs    | Present  | -                    | Self    |
| Simulation refinement backlog              | Present  | -                    | Self    |
| Dependency audit (requirements.txt table)  | Present  | -                    | Self    |
| Sender/receiver workflow docs              | Missing  | Create               | Self    |
| Logs and traceability docs                 | Missing  | Create               | Self    |
| Full project README (end-to-end overview)  | Missing  | Defer (until MVP)    | Self    |
| API schema/docs (receiver endpoint)        | Missing  | Create               | Self    |

## Prioritized "Create Next" List:
1. ADR template and at least one key record
2. Sender/receiver workflow explanation
3. Logs/traceability record and process
4. API documentation for simulation server
5. README (full: defer until MVP for scope control)

---

## Deferral Rationale

The end-to-end project README is intentionally deferred until MVP is built, to avoid premature documentation churn and keep immediate focus on technical delivery.

---

## Reflection

Audit shows most MVP-phase docs are present and useful, except for a few process and traceability artifacts that can be closed quickly. Documenting ADRs now will future-proof further architecture changes and interview prep. README deferred to maintain lean, iterative delivery discipline.
