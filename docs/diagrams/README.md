# Diagrams Guide

Simple diagrams make explanations stronger. Keep them lightweight and versioned.

## Tools
- Excalidraw (hand-drawn style)
- diagrams.net (draw.io)

## Conventions
- Store source files in this folder; export PNG/SVG alongside
- Name files with prefix and date: `p01-telemetry-arch-2025-10-14.excalidraw`
- Keep diagrams small and focused (one concept per diagram)

## How to reference in docs
- Link relative to this repo, e.g.:
  - `![P01 Telemetry MVP](../diagrams/p01-telemetry-arch-2025-10-14.png)`
- Mention related issue and milestone in the caption

## When to add
- New architecture decisions or ADRs
- End-of-MVP retrospective
- Interview prep summaries
