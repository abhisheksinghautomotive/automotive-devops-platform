## Problem Statement: Enterprise Testing Challenge

**Scenario**: Your company needs to test 50+ automotive ECU configurations across multiple vehicle platforms, running 1000+ test cases daily with zero downtime and instant scalability.

**System Design Challenge**: Design a testing platform that can:
- Execute parallel tests across multiple environments
- Scale from 10 to 1000 concurrent test containers
- Provide real-time test results and detailed reporting
- Handle test data management and artifact storage
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines seamlessly
