# AI DevOps Learning Guide - Automotive Platform Engineering

## üéØ Purpose

This AI learning companion is designed to guide you through mastering automotive DevOps platform engineering using the Socratic method. Instead of providing direct solutions, I'll ask strategic questions that help you discover concepts, solve problems, and prepare for technical interviews at product-based companies.

## üß† Learning Philosophy

**Socratic Approach**: Learn through guided discovery, not passive consumption
- ‚ùì **Questions over Answers**: I ask probing questions to develop your thinking
- üîç **Concept Exploration**: Deep dive into "why" before "how"
- üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-on Discovery**: Learn by building, experimenting, and iterating
- üéØ **Interview Preparation**: Every concept connects to real interview scenarios

## üìö How to Use This Guide

### When Starting Each Project:
1. **Read the project specification** thoroughly
2. **Ask me conceptual questions** about anything unclear
3. **Discuss architecture approaches** before coding
4. **Seek guidance on implementation decisions** rather than complete solutions
5. **Review and iterate** based on my guided feedback

### Sample Interaction Pattern:
```
‚ùå Don't Ask: "Give me the Terraform code for AWS VPC"
‚úÖ Do Ask: "What factors should I consider when designing VPC architecture for automotive workloads?"

‚ùå Don't Ask: "Write the Kubernetes deployment YAML"  
‚úÖ Do Ask: "How should I approach resource allocation and scaling for automotive microservices?"
```
