## Problem Statement: Enterprise Deployment Challenge

**Scenario**: Your automotive software company deploys 200+ updates daily across development, staging, and production environments for connected vehicle platforms serving millions of users globally.

**System Design Challenge**: Design a CI/CD platform that can:
- Handle 500+ concurrent pipeline executions
- Deploy to multi-cloud and edge computing environments
- Implement zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
- Ensure security scanning and compliance at every stage
- Provide real-time deployment monitoring and analytics
