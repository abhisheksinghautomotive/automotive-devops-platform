# Project 01: Cloud-Native Automotive Telemetry Platform

## Goal
Build a production-grade, scalable telemetry data pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes automotive CAN bus data at scale - demonstrating system design, practical DSA implementation, and cloud-native DevOps practices essential for product company interviews.

## Problem Statement: Scale Challenge

**Scenario**: Your automotive client expects to onboard 10,000 connected vehicles, each sending CAN data every 200ms. Design and build a system that can handle this scale while maintaining reliability, cost-effectiveness, and real-time insights.

**System Design Challenge**: How do you design a pipeline that can:
- Handle 50,000 messages/second peak load
- Process terabytes of data monthly
- Provide real-time dashboards for fleet management
- Scale elastically based on demand
- Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA
